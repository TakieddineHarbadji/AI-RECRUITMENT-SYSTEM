	Tables Names and join_table Names, must be named like they are in supabase when querying.

1- There are two types of links:
- Basic Handeling:
which take a table and CRUD operations on it based on an id(related to that table only so no foreign keys).

/get_all/{table_name} (gets all instaces in any table)
/get_batch/{table_name}/{start_index}/{batch_size} (gets based on batch size and start_index (from 0))
/get/{table_name}/?record_id=1&record_id=133 (can be used to)

same for others.

- Foreign Handeling:
devided into two one for one to many relations, and one for many to many relations.

the first "/get_by_foreign/{parent_table}/{parent_id}/{child_table}"
takes a parent table which has the id (only Users and Companies tables)
and gives all related instances in the child table.
has a batch version.

the second "/get_by_foreign_many_many/{parent_table}/{parent_id}/{join_table}/{child_table}"
gives all(or some) related child instances to the parent_id.
 (can give specific IDs from child_table too like this:
'/get_by_foreign_many_many/Users/1/Users_Companies/Companies?target_id=1&target_id=133'
)
has batch version.
